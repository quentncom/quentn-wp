# quentn-wp
This plugin allows you to restrict access to specific pages, create custom access links and create dynamic page countdowns.
Optionally, you can connect your [Quentn](https://quentn.com) account to your WordPress installation to share contacts and manage
access restrictions through Quentn.

## Plugin Features 
    
**Page Restriction:** Once the page restriction is activated, the page will only be accessible by invited users.

**Countdown:** Allows you to make the page accessible for a certain period of time.

**Countdown Type:** You can choose between absolute or relative for the countdown type. Using Absolute, the page will be accessible until a specific date for all allowed users,
 while using relative, the page will be accessible for a certain time which starts when the permission has been created.  

**Countdown Clock:** You can display a countdown timer on top of the page.

**Shortcode:** You can use the shortcode *[quentn_flipclock]* in your page to display the countdown timer at a point of your choice.

**Redirection Settings:** Allows you to decide whether to display the message to the user or redirect to another page when user is not allowed to access the page.
